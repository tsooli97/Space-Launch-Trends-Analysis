<h1>Space Launch Trends Analysis</h1>

Welcome to my space-themed data science project! As a space enthusiast, I was excited to dive into a fascinating dataset I found on Kaggle, which details all space missions from 1957 to 2020.

<h3>Project Objective</h3>
The primary aim of this project is to uncover intriguing trends and insights from over six decades of space exploration. From the early days of the space race to recent commercial spaceflights, this analysis seeks to understand how the statistics of space missions have evolved over time.

<h3>Data Source</h3>
The dataset used here is a comprehensive collection from Kaggle. It details various aspects of space missions, including launch dates, mission outcomes, and participating companies or countries:
